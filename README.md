Breakdance consists of a ~20m diameter dodecagonal platform on which five hubs are fixed,
each holding four cars. The entire ride has a 7.5° elevation. The platform rotates when the ride
is turned on, while the hubs revolve in the opposite
direction.
We saw this ride in a nearby amusement park and were instantly tempted to plot the trajectory
of such a three degree of freedom system. However, we ought to make some assumptions to
relax the mathematical complexity. We’ll assume each car to be a hollow cuboid, with half of the
top face absent (so that the rider can go inside). We’ll assume a constant drag coefficient (which
theoretically varies with the shape, orientation, or frontal area). We’ll also assume the distance
of the base of this cuboid from the platform to be negligible.

In our system we have 5 arms connected to the centre of the system(i.e m=5) and at each arm
we have four rides connected to it (i.e n=4). Here the O is the centre of the system which is fixed w.r.t ground frame and length of each arm
(OC) =b. A is the position of the passenger sitting in the ride. General coordinates for this
system are (θ1, θ2, θ3).
Initial positions of the car are shown below:

Here in this report we computed
1. The trajectory of point A
2. Variation of velocity of point A wrt time
3. Variation of acceleration of point A wrt time
4. Normal reaction at point B
5. External moment applied at point B
